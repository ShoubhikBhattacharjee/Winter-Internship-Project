    "answer": "The process of database design typically consists of three fundamental steps carried out by a designer:\n1. Determine the data to be stored: Identifying the required data elements in cooperation with domain experts.\n2. Determine data relationships: Identifying dependencies within the data (e.g., an address being dependent on a name).\n3. Logically structure the data: Arranging the information into a structure (like entities) that can be mapped into the DBMS storage objects.",

Limited representation: It offers less comprehensive relationship representation compared to models like the Relational model.\n3. No data manipulation: It is difficult to represent how data will be manipulated (inserted, updated, or deleted) within the diagram.",
