    "question": "What is the Relational Model?",
    "answer": "The Relational Model was proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970 and is based on the mathematical concept of a relation, which represents data as a table of values. It provides an abstract specification for database management systems through three components: data structures, data manipulation, and data integrity. It allows for powerful query languages and is used to implement the conceptual view of a database.",
