    "question": "What is SQL?",
    "answer": "SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard non-procedural language used to communicate with a relational database management system to perform operations such as retrieval, insertion, updation, and deletion of data. The steps required to execute SQL statements are handled transparently by the SQL database. Unlike procedural languages where details of operations must be specified (opening/closing tables, searching indexes), SQL allows the user to specify 'what' to do rather than 'how' to do it.",

    "question": "What is Data Definition Language (DDL)?",
    "answer": "Data Definition Language (DDL) consists of SQL commands used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects like tables, indexes, and views. DDL operations are auto-committed, meaning changes are saved permanently immediately after execution and cannot be rolled back. It is typically used by DBAs during the design or maintenance phase of the database lifecycle.",

    "question": "What is the CREATE command?",
    "answer": "The CREATE command is a DDL statement used to create new database objects such as tables, schemas, or indexes. It defines the structure by specifying the table name, column names, data types, and any initial constraints required for the table.",

    "answer": "The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object.

    "question": "How are triggers classified?",
    "answer": "Triggers are classified in three ways: by timing, by level, and by event type. \n1. Timing: Classified as BEFORE (fires before the DML operation) or AFTER (fires after the DML operation).\n2. Level: Classified as Row-level (fires for every individual row affected by the SQL statement) or Statement-level (fires once for the entire SQL statement, regardless of how many rows are affected).\n3. Event Type: Classified based on the specific DML operation that triggers it: INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.",

    "question": "What is a BEFORE Trigger?",
    "answer": "A BEFORE trigger fires before the triggering DML statement (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) is executed on the table. It is often used to validate or modify data before it is saved.",

    "question": "What is an AFTER Trigger?",
    "answer": "An AFTER trigger fires after the triggering DML statement has been executed and the data has been modified in the table. It is commonly used for logging, auditing, or updating other related tables.",

    "question": "What is a Row-level Trigger?",
    "answer": "A Row-level trigger fires once for each row that is affected by the triggering DML statement. If an UPDATE statement modifies 10 rows, a row-level trigger will execute 10 times.",

    "question": "What is a Statement-level Trigger?",
    "answer": "A Statement-level trigger fires once for the entire DML statement, regardless of the number of rows affected. Even if the statement modifies 100 rows, the trigger executes only once.",
