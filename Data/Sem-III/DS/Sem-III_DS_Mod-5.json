    "question": "What is a Graph? Explain its basic components.",
    "answer": "A Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connect these vertices. Unlike trees, graphs do not have a strict parent-child relationship and can contain cycles.\nTheory: A graph is mathematically represented as G = (V, E), where V represents the set of vertices and E represents the set of edges. Vertices are the entities or points in the graph, while edges represent the connections or relationships between those entities. Graphs are used to model real-world systems such as social networks, transportation routes, and computer networks.",

    "answer": "To understand graph structures, the following terms are fundamental:\n1. Vertex (V): Also known as a node, it is an individual data element or a point in the graph.\n2. Edge (E): A link or a line that connects two vertices in a graph, representing a relationship between them.\n3. Adjacency: Two vertices are said to be adjacent if there is a direct edge connecting them. If an edge exists between vertex U and V, then U and V are neighbors.",

    "answer": "Structural properties of graphs are defined by these terms:\n1. Degree: The total number of edges connected to a specific vertex. In directed graphs, this is split into 'In-degree' (incoming edges) and 'Out-degree' (outgoing edges).\n2. Path: A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge. It represents a route from a source vertex to a destination.\n3. Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no other repeated vertices or edges.",

    "answer": "An Undirected Graph is a type of graph where the edges do not have a specific direction.\nTheory: In this structure, the edge (A, B) is identical to the edge (B, A). The relationship between the two vertices is bidirectional or mutual. For example, a friendship on a social network where if A is a friend of B, then B is also a friend of A.",

For undirected graphs, the matrix is symmetric.\n2. It allows O(1) time complexity to check if an edge exists.\n3. It consumes O(V^2) space, making it less efficient for sparse graphs.",

Each entry in the array represents a vertex, and the linked list associated with that entry contains all the vertices adjacent to it.\n1. It is memory-efficient for sparse graphs as it only stores existing edges.\n2. The space complexity is O(V + E).\n3. Finding if an edge exists between two nodes takes O(degree of vertex) time.",
