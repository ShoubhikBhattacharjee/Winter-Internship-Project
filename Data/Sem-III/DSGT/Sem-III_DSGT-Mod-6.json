    "question": "What is a graph in Discrete Mathematics?",
    "answer": "A graph is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects. It is formally defined as G = (V, E), where V is a non-empty set of vertices (or nodes) and E is a set of edges (or links) that connect these vertices. If the edges have no direction, it is an undirected graph; otherwise, it is a directed graph.\n\n**Example:** A social network where each person is a vertex and a 'friendship' is an edge connecting two people.\n\n",

    "question": "What are the main components of a graph?",
    "answer": "The primary components are:\n1. **Vertices (V):** The individual points or nodes in the graph.\n2. **Edges (E):** The lines that connect two vertices. An edge is represented as a set {u, v} for undirected graphs or an ordered pair (u, v) for directed graphs.\n3. **Degree:** The number of edges incident to a vertex. In directed graphs, this is split into 'in-degree' and 'out-degree'.\n\n**Example:** In a city map graph, intersections are vertices and the roads connecting them are edges.",

    "answer": "A simple graph is a graph that contains no self-loops (an edge connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges (more than one edge between the same two vertices). Every edge in a simple graph connects two distinct vertices and is unique.\n\n**Example:** A standard 'square' graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges forming a perimeter is a simple graph.\n\n",

    "answer": "A directed graph, or digraph, consists of vertices connected by directed edges (arrows). Each edge has a specific orientation, meaning the relationship is not necessarily reciprocal. The edge (u, v) is distinct from (v, u).\n\n**Example:** A website's structure where vertices are pages and edges are hyperlinks. Clicking a link takes you from Page A to Page B, but Page B may not link back to Page A.\n\n",

For undirected graphs, the matrix is always symmetric.\n\n**Example:** If vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 3, the first row of the matrix would be [0, 1, 1, ...].\n\n[Image showing a graph and its corresponding adjacency matrix]",
