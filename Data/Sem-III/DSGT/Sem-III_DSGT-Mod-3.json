    "question": "What is a Function?",
    "answer": "A function from set A to set B is a special type of relation that assigns exactly one element of B to each element of A. In formal terms, for a relation f to be a function, every input x in the domain must have a unique output y in the codomain. \n\n**Example:** If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {x, y, z}, a function could be f = {(1, x), (2, y), (3, z)}. However, if we had g = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, z)}, it would not be a function because the element 1 is associated with two different elements in B.\n\n",

The Range (or Image) is the subset of the codomain that contains only the elements actually produced by the function's mapping. \n\n**Example:** Consider a function f from Integers to Integers defined by f(x) = x squared.

This means that no two distinct inputs share the same output; if f(a) = f(b), then a must equal b. \n\n**Example:** The function f(x) = 2x for real numbers is injective because every unique x results in a unique 2x. Conversely, f(x) = x squared is not injective over the set of all real numbers because f(2) = 4 and f(-2) = 4.\n\n",

In other words, the Range of the function is exactly equal to its Codomain, and no element in B is left unmapped. \n\n**Example:** Let f(x) = x + 1 for real numbers. Since every real number y in the codomain can be reached by the input x = y - 1, the function is surjective. However, f(x) = e^x is not surjective over real numbers because negative numbers are never reached.\n\n",
