    "question": "What is Propositional Logic?",
    "answer": "Propositional Logic is a branch of discrete mathematics that deals with propositions and logical relationships between them using logical connectives. Theory: It is a formal system in which formulas representing propositions can be formed by combining atomic propositions using logical connectives. Example: In computer science, it is used to simplify boolean expressions in code to improve efficiency.",

    "question": "What is a Proposition?",
    "answer": "A proposition is a declarative statement that has a definite truth value, either true or false but not both. Theory: To be a proposition, a sentence must assert a fact; therefore, questions, commands, and exclamations are excluded. Example: 'Paris is the capital of France' is a proposition (True), whereas 'Close the door' is not.",

    "question": "What are Simple and Compound Propositions?",
    "answer": "A simple proposition contains no logical connectives, while a compound proposition is formed by combining propositions using logical connectives. Theory: Simple propositions are 'atomic' and cannot be broken down further, whereas compound propositions are 'molecular'. Example: Simple: 'It is sunny'. Compound: 'It is sunny AND it is hot'.",

    "answer": "Logical connectives are symbols used to connect propositions, including AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), IMPLIES (→), and IF AND ONLY IF (↔).
