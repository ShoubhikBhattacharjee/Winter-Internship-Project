    "answer": "A function of a complex variable f(z) is a rule that assigns a complex value w to each complex number z = x + iy in a domain D. It is expressed as w = f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y), where u and v are real-valued functions of the coordinates x and y. In engineering, u often represents a potential (like electrostatic potential) and v represents a stream function, which are essential for modeling fluid flow and electromagnetic fields.",
