    "question": "What are Dirichlet’s conditions for a function to have a Fourier series expansion?",
    "answer": "A function f(x) can be expanded into a Fourier series in a given interval if it satisfies three specific criteria known as Dirichlet's conditions: (1) f(x) must be periodic, single-valued, and finite. (2) f(x) must have a finite number of maxima and minima within one period. (3) f(x) must have a finite number of finite discontinuities within one period. These conditions are sufficient but not strictly necessary; however, for most physical signals in engineering, they ensure the series converges to the function at points of continuity and to the average value at points of jump discontinuity.",

    "answer": "A Fourier series represents a periodic function f(x) as an infinite sum of simple harmonic oscillations (sines and cosines): f(x) = a0/2 + Σ [an cos(nx) + bn sin(nx)].

This is the basis for frequency-domain analysis, allowing engineers to understand the harmonic content of electrical signals, vibrations, and acoustic waves.",
