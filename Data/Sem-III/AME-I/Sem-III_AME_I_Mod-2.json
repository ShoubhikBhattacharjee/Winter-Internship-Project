    "question": "What is the Inverse Laplace Transform and its mathematical foundation?",
    "answer": "The Inverse Laplace Transform is the mathematical operation used to transform a function from the complex frequency domain F(s) back into the time domain f(t). If L{f(t)} = F(s), then f(t) = L^-1{F(s)}. Theoretically, it is based on the Mellin's inversion formula, also known as the Bromwich Integral, which is a complex line integral. In practice, engineers avoid complex integration by using standard transform tables and the property of uniqueness, which states that if two functions have the same Laplace transform, they are identical except at isolated points.",

    "answer": "Linearity is a core property stating that L^-1{a F(s) + b G(s)} = a L^-1{F(s)} + b L^-1{G(s)}, where a and b are constants. This allows us to decompose complex, multi-term rational functions into simpler components that can be solved individually. For example, if a control system's output is represented by a sum of different frequency components, linearity allows us to find the time-domain response of each component and sum them to find the total response.",
