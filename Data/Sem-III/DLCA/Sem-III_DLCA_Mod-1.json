    "question": "Define the Decimal Number System and its positional representation.",
    "answer": "The Decimal number system is a base-10 (radix 10) system using ten distinct digits: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Each digit's value is determined by its position, which represents a power of 10. For example, in (235.7)₁₀, the '2' represents 2 \u00d7 10\u00b2 and the '7' represents 7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9.",

    "answer": "The Binary number system is a base-2 system using only two digits: {0, 1}. It is the fundamental language of digital computers because electronic circuits can easily represent two states (on/off). Each bit position corresponds to a power of 2. Example: (110.01)\u2082 = (1\u00d72\u00b2) + (1\u00d72\u00b9) + (0\u00d72\u2070) + (0\u00d72\u207b\u00b9) + (1\u00d72\u207b\u00b2).",
