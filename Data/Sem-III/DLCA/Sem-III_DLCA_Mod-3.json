    "question": "Design and explain a Full Adder using Half Adders and basic gates.",
    "answer": "A Full Adder can be constructed using two Half Adders and an OR gate. The first Half Adder adds bits A and B to produce an intermediate sum and carry. The second Half Adder then adds this intermediate sum to the input carry Cin to produce the final Sum. The carries from both Half Adders are fed into an OR gate to generate the final Carry Output Cout. This demonstrates that complex arithmetic can be built from simpler functional units.",

    "answer": "A Combinational Circuit is a digital circuit where the output at any time depends solely on the current combination of inputs, such as Adders or Multiplexers. They do not have memory. A Sequential Circuit is a digital circuit where the output depends on current inputs and past history or previous states. They utilize memory elements like flip flops and often a clock signal.",
