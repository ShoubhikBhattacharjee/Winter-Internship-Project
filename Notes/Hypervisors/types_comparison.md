# Hypervisor Types Comparison

## Type 1 (Bare Metal)
Type 1 hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and to manage guest operating systems.
- **Examples:** VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM.
- **Pros:** High performance and security because they don't run on an intermediate OS.

## Type 2 (Hosted)
Type 2 hypervisors run on a conventional operating system (like Windows, Linux, or macOS) just as other computer programs do.
- **Examples:** VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and VMware Fusion.
- **Pros:** Easy to set up and great for development or testing on a personal computer.
