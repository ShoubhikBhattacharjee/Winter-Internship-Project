# Machine Learning: Supervised vs. Unsupervised

## Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a **labeled dataset**. This means the data already contains the "answers" (labels), and the model learns to map inputs to these specific outputs.
- **Process:** It uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output.
- **Goal:** To predict outcomes for new, unseen data.
- **Common Tasks:** - **Classification:** Categorizing data (e.g., Identifying an email as Spam or Not Spam).
  - **Regression:** Predicting a continuous value (e.g., Estimating house prices).

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster **unlabeled datasets**. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without human intervention.
- **Process:** It finds structure in data that hasn't been categorized or labeled.
- **Goal:** To explore the structure of the data and find naturally occurring patterns.
- **Common Tasks:** - **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., Segmenting customers by purchasing habits).
  - **Association:** Finding rules that describe your data (e.g., People who buy coffee also buy milk).

## Key Comparison Table
| Feature | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Type** | Labeled Data | Unlabeled Data |
| **Output** | Predicted value/category | Hidden patterns/groupings |
| **Complexity** | Simple to understand | More complex/mathematical |
| **Accuracy** | High (with good labels) | Variable (exploratory) |
